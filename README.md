# Soldering Iron Telegram Bot
 
Sometimes I forget to turn off my soldering iron after working on a project. I’ll come into my office the next morning and find my iron has been left on all night! I connected an ESP microcontroller and relay to my soldering iron to help solve this problem. After the iron has been on for a predetermined amount of time, it’ll send me a message letting me know about my forgetfulness. I also gave it some extra personality and the ability to turn itself off if I don’t reply right away.
